# Module 3: Isaac Sim

Welcome to Module 3! In this module, we'll explore Isaac Sim, NVIDIA's advanced simulation platform specifically designed for AI-powered robots. Isaac Sim combines high-fidelity physics simulation with state-of-the-art graphics and AI training capabilities.

## Overview

Isaac Sim is NVIDIA's next-generation robotics simulation environment built on the Omniverse platform. It's designed specifically for developing, testing, and training AI-powered robots with:

- **Photorealistic rendering**: Advanced graphics for computer vision training
- **High-fidelity physics**: Accurate simulation for robot control
- **AI training integration**: Built-in tools for reinforcement learning
- **Realistic sensor simulation**: Cameras, LIDAR, IMU, and more
- **GPU acceleration**: Leveraging NVIDIA's hardware for performance

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:
- Understand the architecture and capabilities of Isaac Sim
- Learn how to set up and configure Isaac Sim environments
- Know how to import and simulate robots in Isaac Sim
- Understand the AI training capabilities and workflows
- Learn about Isaac Sim's sensor simulation and computer vision features

## Module Structure

This module contains 3 chapters that progressively build your understanding of Isaac Sim:

- **Chapter 1**: Introduction to Isaac Sim and Omniverse
- **Chapter 2**: Robot Simulation and Control in Isaac Sim
