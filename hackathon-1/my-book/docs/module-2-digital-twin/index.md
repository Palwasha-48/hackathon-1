# Module 2: Digital Twin Technologies (Gazebo/Unity)

Welcome to Module 2! In this module, we'll explore digital twin technologies - virtual replicas of physical systems that are essential for developing and testing humanoid robots safely and efficiently.

## Overview

A digital twin in robotics is a virtual representation of a physical robot that mirrors its behavior, appearance, and responses in a simulated environment. For humanoid robots, digital twins allow us to:

- Test control algorithms without risk of physical damage
- Train AI systems in safe virtual environments
- Validate sensor data processing pipelines
- Optimize robot designs before physical construction
- Accelerate development cycles significantly

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:
- Understand what digital twins are and why they're crucial for robotics
- Learn the fundamentals of Gazebo and Unity as simulation platforms
- Know how to create and configure robot models in simulation
- Understand the differences between physics engines and their applications
- Learn how to transfer knowledge from simulation to real robots (sim-to-real)

## Module Structure

This module contains 3 chapters that progressively build your understanding of digital twin technologies:

- **Chapter 1**: Introduction to Digital Twins in Robotics
- **Chapter 2**: Gazebo Simulation for Robotics
- **Chapter 3**: Unity for Robot Simulation and Training

After completing these chapters, you'll take a quiz to reinforce your learning.
