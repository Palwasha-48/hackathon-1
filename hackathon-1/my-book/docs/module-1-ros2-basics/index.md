# Module 1: ROS2 Basics

Welcome to the foundational module of our Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics course! In this module, you'll learn about ROS2 (Robot Operating System 2), the essential middleware that connects all components of a robot system.

## Overview

ROS2 is not an operating system in the traditional sense, but rather a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that help developers create robot applications. It provides services like hardware abstraction, device drivers, libraries, visualizers, message-passing, package management, and more.

For humanoid robots, ROS2 serves as the "nervous system" that allows different components to communicate seamlessly. Sensors publish data, controllers subscribe to that data and send commands to actuators, and all of this happens through ROS2's communication framework.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:
- Understand the core concepts of ROS2 and why it's essential for robotics
- Learn how to work with ROS2 packages, nodes, topics, and services
- Create your first ROS2 publisher and subscriber
- Understand how ROS2 enables complex robot behaviors through distributed computing

## Module Structure

This module contains 3 chapters that progressively build your understanding of ROS2:

- **Chapter 1**: Introduction to ROS2 Concepts
- **Chapter 2**: ROS2 Communication Patterns
- **Chapter 3**: Building Your First ROS2 Robot Application

After completing these chapters, you'll take a quiz to reinforce your learning.
