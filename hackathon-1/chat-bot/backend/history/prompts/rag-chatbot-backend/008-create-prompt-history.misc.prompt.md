## Prompt

/sp.phr

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete development history documented for future reference
- 🧪 Tests: All implementation tested and documented
- 📁 Files: 8 PHR files created in history/prompts/rag-chatbot-backend/
- 🔁 Next prompts: None - project complete
- 🧠 Reflection: PHR process captures full development workflow for reproducibility

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - clean documentation process
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A - documentation phase
- Prompt variant (if applicable): phr-creation-v1
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Use PHRs to reproduce implementation in new project
