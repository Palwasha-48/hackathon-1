**Feature**: 001-course-content
**Status**: Complete

## Overview

This guide provides a step-by-step approach to developing the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course following the established structure and quality standards. The course follows the sequence: Course Introduction → Module 1 (ROS2) → Module 2 (Digital Twin) → Module 3 (Isaac) → Module 4 (VLA).

## Getting Started

### 1. Environment Setup
- Ensure you have a text editor capable of handling Markdown files
- Set up version control with Git
- Create the directory structure as defined in the plan
- Install any required simulation environments (Gazebo, Unity, Isaac Sim)

### 2. Content Development Framework
- Follow the 4-module structure: ROS2 → Digital Twin → Isaac → VLA
- Each module contains exactly 3 lessons and 1 quiz
- Maintain beginner-friendly language throughout
- Include practical robotics examples in each lesson

### 3. Writing Standards
- Use simple, clear, and encouraging language
- Define technical terms when first introduced
- Keep paragraphs short (2-3 sentences)
- Include 2-3 practical robotics examples per lesson
- Apply consistent visual design elements
